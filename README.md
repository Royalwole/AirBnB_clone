# AirBnB Clone
## Description of the project
The goal of the project is to create a replica of the [Airbnb Website](https://www.airbnb.com/) using my server. The final version of this project will have:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
- A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
- A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.
